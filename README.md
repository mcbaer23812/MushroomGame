# Mushroom Game
Mushroom Game is a 2D platformer game created using the libGDX framework, Box2D physics engine, Tiled (map editor), and JProfiler (memory analysis). The goal of the game will be to navigate the shroomy protagonist through multiple levels, collecting items along the way while surviving challenges. This project serves as a personal learning and development exercise in game design using real-world libraries, engines, and applications while also solving real-world problems. It remains in active development, with components added when I have time.
